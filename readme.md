## Problem Being Solved and Target Market

Problem: My personal site is not very robust. Time to change that. This will be a good example of basic skills I can show to potential employers. 

On the main page, there will be a quote of the day displayed above the nav bar at the top of the screen, using the https://quotes.rest/ API.

In sub sections there will be some work with other APIs, namely one I did with the NASA API and the project for the weather API with the bonus completed.
